-- comment:
--   This generates the output samples of the wave  generator.
--   
-- When enabled via the samp_gen_go_clk_rx signal, which is either  pulsed
--   for 3 clocks or continuously asserted, it will cycle through all  nsamp
--   samples at a rate of one sample every 'speed' cycles of the  prescaled
--   clock (clk_samp), which is synchronous to clk_tx, but asserted only  one
--   out of every 'prescale'  cycles.
--   
-- The samp_gen_go_clk_rx signal must be synchronized to clk_tx, and  held
--   until the next rising edge of clk_samp (as indicated by the  en_clk_samp)
--   signal.
